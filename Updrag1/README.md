This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. 

In this game, the player enters one of the three options 1 for Rock, 2 for Paper and  3 for Scissors 
If player enters any other nnumber, is prompted to enter valid number.
The computer randomly selects one of the three options (Rock, Paper, Scissors). The choices are then displayed simultaneously, and the winner is determined based on the following rules:

Rock wins over scissors, Scissors wins over paper, Paper wins over rock If both the computer and the player choose the same option, the result is a tie.

The player is asked if player wants to continue playing after every turn, if player chooses 'y' game continues, if player chooses 'n' game ends.
